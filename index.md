# 10th International Workshop on Requirements Engineering Education and Training (REET)
## Zurich, Switzerland, August 31, 2020
## A workshop in conjunction with [RE'20](https://re20.org)

### Overview

The 10th International Workshop on Requirements Engineering Education and Training (REET) aims to close the gap between the RE needs of industry and the RE concepts and skills taught in our classrooms. Experience has shown that effective requirements engineering (RE) practices are essential to the success of software development projects, but many aspiring software developers still have few or no opportunities to learn or practice RE during their professional preparation. 

REET provides a space for participants to share ideas, successes, challenges, and lessons learnt regarding the teaching and learning of RE skills and methodologies in all contexts including undergraduate, graduate, and professional education. Consistent with the main theme of RE’20, “RE for a Digital World”, this workshop aims to understand how we, as educators/trainers, must evolve to meet the new demands caused by developments such as intelligent and self-learning systems as we prepare students and trainees to address the challenges of RE. By focusing on educational transfer, we hope to increase the impact of RE curriculum content while identifying the latest RE challenges to improve pedagogical approaches in RE.

This workshop also aims to foster collaboration and sharing of RE training materials and best practices, including active/inclusive learning techniques and new ways to integrate RE concepts across software engineering and computer science curricula. To do this, we encourage RE educators to submit summaries of RE teaching/training activities that they have used, in addition to research papers or extended abstracts. Accepted activity summaries may be included in a new open repository of resources for RE education and training, at the author’s option.

This workshop is anticipated to address pedagogical and educational challenges in RE, and their practical impacts on the quality of current/future research studies conducted at the academic or industry levels. Bridging between a wide range of abstract concepts and practical techniques in RE is always a major challenge which needs development of skill sets that are not instructed in a single handbook and must be learned or taught by a combination of student-centered and active learning pedagogical methods. By continuing dialogue on these issues, we also anticipate opening new avenues of study and research, which will improve the skill set of learners at postsecondary institutions and in industry.

### Call for Participation

We invite submissions of contributions in any of these categories. All contributions must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. Accepted papers with at least one author who registers for and presents at the workshop will be submitted for publication in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. 

#### Full Papers
Full papers (maximum 8 pages) may describe requirements engineering educational techniques and pedagogical approaches, survey results or experiential reports. For example, a full paper might describe a specific technique for teaching an RE skill and include a case study describing its implementation and evaluation of its effectiveness as well as lessons learnt. As another example, a full paper might describe a mature tool for supporting RE training and experience of using the tool with learners.

#### Extended Abstracts
Extended abstracts (maximum 2 pages) can be on any of the topics within the scope of the workshop. They will be evaluated based on their potential for generating discussion, as well as quality and originality. Abstracts will generally have one of 3 forms: 
  1. position papers that reflect on RE education, 
  2. experience reports that describe experiences with a particular method for teaching an RE related skill or could describe an innovative approach to incorporating RE education into the degree curriculum, or
  3. educational study design papers that propose an empirical study where the authors are looking to get feedback prior to completing the study (or where only a proof of concept has been completed). 

#### Activity Summaries
Activity summaries (maximum 2 pages + appendix) will describe a teaching activity and in a separate appendix provide the materials needed to reproduce that activity in the classroom. Workshop participants, **including paper authors**, will be encouraged to submit a RE activity. RE activities will be documented using a predefined format (_which will be posted by March 9, 2020_), and will focus on one or more RE skills, define target audience and learning goals, provide step-by-step guidelines for conducting the activity, including student hand-outs or associated slides, describe the context of the activity, and briefly comment on its prior use in the classroom. 

### Submission Requirements

Submissions must be 
* written in English,
* formatted according to the [RE'20 conference formatting instructions](https://re20.org/index.php/formatting-instructions/), and
* submitted as a single PDF file through the [EasyChair site for REET'20](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=reet20).

REET does not require you to submit your title or abstract in advance.

Note that acceptance of a paper or extended abstract obligates at least one of the authors to register for and present at the workshop. Failure to register for the workshop by the early registration date will result in the contribution being withdrawn from the workshop proceedings.

When you are ready, [submit your paper, extended abstract, or activity using EasyChair](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=reet20).
