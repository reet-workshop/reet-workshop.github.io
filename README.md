# reet-workshop.github.io
Website for REET Workshop

We can fill in documentation about the REET workshop website here. Zach will post notes about how he is updating this site once he figures out how to do that :-).

Right now, the site is only 1 page with all of the key information.

At some point, we'll want to figure out a way to archive previous REET workshop sites (that we host), as well as the repository that we're promising. Maybe a URL scheme like reet-workshop dot github dot io slash 2020, ... slash 2021, and so on?

Current theme is Dinky: https://pages-themes.github.io/dinky/
